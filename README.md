# Add-on tds_enhanced_version_list

This add-on displays a list of collection versions including a table sorter. All obsolete versions can be deleted. Obsolete versions are defined as versions of a collection having version number less than a present approved version number or highest version number, if no approved version present.

Localization is available for de_DE, feel free to add more.

This add-on is based on the add-on global_version_list (http://www.concrete5.org/marketplace/addons/list-of-all-page-versions) Thanks to "guyasyou" (http://www.concrete5.org/profile/-/view/87890/) giving permission to enhace his work.
